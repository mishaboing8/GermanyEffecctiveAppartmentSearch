# GermanyEffecctiveAppartmentSearch
Scrap all apartments from url, calculate and sort by warm quadratmeter price lower -> higher

Hi guys, there i have one of my old projects.
By using it its necessary to enter your searching url and output file name. Example: https://www.immobilienscout24.de/Suche/de/hamburg/hamburg/wohnung-mieten?enteredFrom=one_step_search
Programm supports those websites: saga.de, immowelt.de, immobilienscout24.de. By giving your url, program will scrap website, calculate warm prise, and write all apartments by price from lower to higher PRO QUADRATMETER.

WHY?
This possibility gives no one from current websites. By sorting all apartments by warm quadratmeter price you can see all best deals in Germany and be the first to buy/book apartments. Of course you could do it by your self, but:
1) In Hamburg normally there are 850 every day;
2) It is necessary to calculate warm price (Heizkosten, Nebenkosten, Extra) by visiting every apartment page;
3) Calculate price pro qd. meter;

Now you see instead of one week it will be possible to see results after a few minutes, plus it is not cold moth price like it normally is written.

Use and enjoy.
